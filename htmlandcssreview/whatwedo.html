                <h2>We Love Making Art!</h2>
                <p>So what do we do at The Collage? We love to make art in every form and fashion. Our company creates several pieces of art and commissions for local businesses and auctions. Even 50% of profit is donated to art programs for children in schools! We believe expressing ourselves through physical media is important for the human mind and soul. So as we make art ourselves, we also provide as many materials as we possibly can in the space we have for anyone to come and enjoy their newly discovered hobby with a drink and a snack!</p>
