                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>With a subscription of $25 a month, you can come in from 8am - 8pm and try out any artsy medium of your choosing. All ages welcome until 5pm when it is adults only! We have always dreamt of somewhere to store and attempt any hobby without having to buy them and store them. No more discovering your dislike of something and having to decide what to do with the rest of the materials! We got you.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>As a child, I have always wanted to try EVERYTHING. Well, almost everything. My poor mother having to find the funds and the space for all of the hobbies I wanted, I'm sure it became exhausting. As I grew older, I realized I am not alone! Several people want to attempt many different hobbies but don't have the resources to do so. That's why we created this business for those who maybe have ADHD like I do, or just have several interests without enough time, funds, or space. Additionally, art with a little drink to sip on while surrounded by friends doing their thing is such a wonderful experience!</p>
